# Mic-2 processor
In fact, this project is not only about a processor, but contain a whole Von Neumann architecture, with in addition a RAM an input unit and an output unit. The project is a simplistic educative realisation of a whole 8 bit architecture in [Logsim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), the processor called Mic-2 was inspired from [Mic-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIC-1) processor whom was described in the popular book [Structured Computer Organization](https://www.amazon.com/Structured-Computer-Organization-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0132916525) by A. Tanenbaum, however the detailed implementation was guided by D.C. Schuurman paper [Step-by-step design and simulation of a simple CPU architecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2445196.2445296)
